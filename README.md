Python practice projects and small tools for data analysis and automation

# Python Programming Portfolio

This repository is a comprehensive collection of python-exercises developed during my programming journey. It covers a wide spectrum of concepts, including fundamental logic, complex algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and practical data processing.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

These projects represent the core of my technical capabilities, focusing on real-world logic and system design.

### 1. Football League Table System (`league_table_system.py`)
- **Description**: A robust system that processes match results to generate a complete league standings table.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Calculates points, goals for/against, and goal difference.
  - Implements a multi-tier sorting algorithm (Points > Goal Difference > Goals For > Name) using `lambda` functions.
  - Uses Class-based architecture for clean data management.

### 2. Advanced Passport Management System (`passport_management.py`)
- **Description**: A professional simulation of a passport issuance and travel tracking system.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Manages personal data and validates expiry dates.
  - Tracks travel history with a "stamp" system and calculates visit statistics.
  - Supports data persistence by exporting records to JSON files.
  - Implements custom exception handling (`CountryNotVisitedError`).

### 3. Corporate Payroll & Project Analyser (`payroll_data_analyser.py`)
- **Description**: A data-driven tool designed to process corporate payroll records and project costs.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Parses CSV files using `DictReader` to aggregate work hours and payout totals.
  - Identifies the "hardest worker" based on maximum hours logged.
  - Provides department-wise cost analysis for financial reporting.
